          <img src="images/img1.jpg" style="width:100% height:500px;">
          <div class="text">Multi-Talented</div>
          <div class="cap-text">She is multi-talented. She’s not a trick pony. She had her own hit teleserye, ‘On The Wings of Love’. Starred as the female lead in several critically-acclaimed movies like ‘Never Not Love You’. Hosts and performs in noontime shows like ‘It’s Showtime’. She’s also part of an affluent music label in the country, Careless Music Manila. Has her own makeup line. And she’s the first Filipina ambassador of the global retail giant, H&M. </div>

            <img src="images/img2.jpg" style="width:100%">
            <div class="text">Fashionable and Fun</div>
            <div class="cap-text"> She has graced the covers of some of the biggest magazine companies in the country. She even made back-to-back cover appearances in Mega, Preview, Metro, and Cosmopolitan among many others. Aside from that, she has a great sense of fashion as well. She sports a lot of OOTDs that range from cute, classy, sporty, and downright sexy. And if you check out her Instagram feed, you’d definitely love her aesthetic.

            <div class="text">Go-Getter and Trendsetter</div>
            <div class="cap-text"> She is the face of a long list of brands in the country. Let me remind you, she has her own BYS makeup line and a swimsuit collection with H&M. The release of her BYS makeup line, Lustrous, garnered the attention of her fans, thus, increasing the sales of BYS. While H&M’s Swimsuit Essentials by Nadine Lustre is a ticking timebomb itself. Fans are clearly waiting for the drop of her swimsuit line in all H&M stores nationwide. Why? Because Nadine just gave us the inspiration of wearing one this coming summer. I mean, she’s that influential.

            <div class="text"> Unfiltered and Real</div>
            <div class="cap-text">She keeps it real. She’s proud and strong of who she is and she refuses to cower over the pressure of others. She oozes with personality during the interview and even when hosting or guesting. Being a celebrity is definitely daunting, especially with all the cameras and paparazzi.

            <div class="text">Miss Independent</div>
            <div class="cap-text">She’s a great role model for modern Filipinas. Just recently, Nadine’s movie ‘Ulan’ premiered, with Carlo Aquino as her leading man. Even before the movie’s released, it surprised everyone that James won’t be the male lead. However, James shows support for Nadine’s endeavor and aspirations in her career. So you can say that Nadine can be of her own when it comes to projects like films. And we stan a woman who knows how to stand on her own two feet.

      Don't be afraid to dress up or show everyone who you really are.
      There are so many people in the world, and the only way for people to remember you is for you to stand out.
       And for you to stand out, you just have to be yourself.

    I'm not adjusting my life based on my image. I'm not their canvas.
    I am my own canvas and I'm my own artist. I paint what I want and no one else can touch it.

If you think you're weak, you will be weak. If you tell yourself you are not worthy, you will be unworthy.
But, if you say you're strong, you will be strong and if you tell yourself you can do it, you can do anything.
The only validation that you will ever need is one from yourself.
